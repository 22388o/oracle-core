# Bootstrap CLI
This is a CLI tool which simplifies the process of bootstrapping an Oracle Pool. The CLI tool exposes 5 actions, one for each of the following tasks:
1. `generatePoolToken` to generate a singleton pool token
2. `generateOracleTokens` to generate multiple oracle tokens
3. `getContractAddresses` Getting the addresses using the tokens generated
4. `bootStrapPool` Bootstrapping the epoch preparation box using the address and tokens
5. `bootStrapOracle` Bootstrapping the oracle boxes using the address and tokens


## Getting Started

Please enter the correct sub-folder matching the version of the Oracle Pool smart contracts that you are using. The readme will guide you in bootstrapping your Oracle Pool.

If you are unsure which to use then you should pick the latest version.

**Latest Version:** [v0.2](v0.2)
