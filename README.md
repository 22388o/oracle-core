# Oracle Core
The off-chain component that oracles who are part of an oracle pool must run. This oracle core provides an HTTP interface for submitting datapoints to and will automatically generate and post transactions, thereby participating in the oracle pool protocol without any extra work by the oracle.

Do note, that the oracle core requires the user to have access to a full node in order to perform UTXO-set scanning.
